              <h3>Brooklyn, NY</h3>
              <p class="about-text">I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
              <p class="about-text">I grew up in the vibrant neighborhood of Crown Heights. It's a lively community filled with Caribbean descendants, delicious food, vibrant music, captivating murals, and a friendly atmosphere.</p>
              <p class="about-text">Growing up in Brooklyn inspired me to learn how to play the bass guitar and alto saxophone. The neighborhood was always filled with the soulful sounds of jazz, and I couldn't help but be drawn to it.</p>

              <h3>Hiking</h3>
              <p class="about-text">Hiking is one of my favorite pastimes.</p>
              <p class="about-text">My most memorable achievement so far has been conquering Yosemite National Park's Four Mile Trail. It's a challenging trail with an elevation gain of around 3,200 ft.</p>
              <p class="about-text">During my final year at Cornell, I had the opportunity to explore the beautiful trails, lakes, and waterfalls in Ithaca. Some of my favorites were Buttermilk Falls, Cascadilla Falls, and the Lake Treman Loop.</p>

              <h3>Playing Pool</h3>
              <p class="about-text">Playing pool has become a beloved hobby of mine.</p>
              <p class="about-text">Initially, I wasn't interested in the game, perhaps because no one taught me how to properly play. But once I learned the hand positions for aiming and mastered controlling the power behind each shot, I quickly grew to enjoy it.</p>
              <p class="about-text">Now I'm learning new trick shots and ball spin tricks to add more excitement and competition when playing with friends and family.</p>

              <h3>Traveling</h3>
              <p class="about-text">Traveling is a source of joy for me.</p>
              <p class="about-text">My family and I used to travel to Haiti every summer until 2008. After a 14-year hiatus, I finally had the chance to travel again with my sister for a much-needed end-of-the-school-year reset in Montego Bay, Jamaica. This trip allowed me to experience the beauty of other countries like Saint Thomas, Colombia, and Mexico, and I look forward to exploring more destinations in the future.</p>
              <p class="about-text">My goal is to visit 30 countries before turning 30, and I hope to embark on solo adventures for a third of those trips. With time, I aim to get closer to achieving that goal and broaden my horizons even further.</p>
